/*
  This is an extension of the built in SPI functions that provides more robust operation and easier use.

  This has been written work on devices with 1 or 2 SPI ports.
  If you are using a device with more than 2 SPI ports those will need to be added to the source code

  Please NOTE!!!!  Many modules will require that we configure the SPIxCON SMP & CKE bits to get it to interface properly with the device
  The default values here work on some devices, but may not work on your device.  I suggest #defining the con settings in your own h file

  This function configures the SPI port specified by "spi_port", with spi_con_value, spi_state_value and bit_rate.
  On some processors 
  The bit rate is determined by a set of dividers on the fcy_clk.
  The bit rate selected will be the maximum realisable bit rate than is less than or equal "bit_rate".
  The minimum bit rate is fcy_clk/512.  If the request bit rate is less than fcy_clk/512 the bit rate will be fcy_clk/512.  

  
  Some of the processers have one configuration register "spi_con_value", and some processors have two configuration registers "spi_con_value" & "spi_con2_value"
  If you are using a processor with only one configuration register spi_con2_value is ignored
